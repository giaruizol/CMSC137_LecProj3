Congestion Control on TCP<br /><br />

In TCP congestion control, the senders continue to increase their rate until they see packet drops in the network. Packet drops occur because the senders are sending at a rate that is faster than the rate at which a particular router in the network might be able to drain its buffer. If there are multiple senders sending at a rate that is equal to the rate at which the router is able to send traffic downstream, then eventually this buffer will fill up. TCP interprets packet loss as congestion. Senders slow down as a result of packet loss. In some cases, particularly in wireless networks, there may be packet loss due to corrupted packets as a result of interference. In many cases, packet drops do result because some router in the network has a buffer that has filled up and can no longer hold anymore packets. Hence, it drops the packets as they arrive, and senders increase rates until packets are dropped, periodically probing the network to check whether more bandwidth has become available. Then senders see packet loss, interpret that as congestion, and slow down. Congestion control has two parts. One is an increase algorithm and another is a decrease algorithm. In the increase algorithm, the sender must test the network to determine whether the network can sustain a higher sending rate. In the decrease algorithm, the senders react to congestion to achieve optimal loss rates, delays in sending rates.
